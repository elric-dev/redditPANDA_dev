 'selftext': u"Hey, so I'm writing this while in class. I just went to the nurse and explained that I've been on my period for 19 days and I'm feeling really dizzy and light headed because of it (I think). I'm 16, a virgin and I've never been on birth control. She was super unhelpful and told me to drink more water and to go to my doctor. That's probably a good idea, but realistically I'm in school this whole week and I don't have time for this. I can't really miss school especially this week. So I was wondering... how urgent do you think this issue is? Is it worth going to the doctor ASAP or would it be okay to wait until the weekend?",
